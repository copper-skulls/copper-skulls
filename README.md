✨ Hi, My username is copper-skulls but my name's **Lupik**, call me that, please! ✨

This account is for my personal projects, fun stuff etc...
That doesn't mean they won't be maintained! They simply aren't part
of my dayjob. :)

If you have issues/questions about anything, don't be afraid to open an issue!
That's probably the easiest way how to get a hold of me, as well.

💻 **Current plans:**
- 🖋️ fountain parser/converter python library (schoolwork)
- 🐉 🖋️ NaNoWriMo+Flight Rising badge pages, Flight Rising resources page
