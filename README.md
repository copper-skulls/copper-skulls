Personal, non-work account. Though some work lives in private - do you know what an SSH mess it is to have two GitHub accounts? It's not worth it - don't do it.

If you have issues/questions about anything, don't be afraid to open an issue!

💻 **Current plans:**
- 🖋️ fountain parser/converter python library (schoolwork)
- 🐉 🖋️ NaNoWriMo+Flight Rising badge pages, Flight Rising resources page
